# Open Balena API

## What is this?

This project is the open sourced Balena API - from the folks at balena.io

Balena.io builds a platform to manage deployments to IoT devices, using containers as deployment mechanism.
The end devices run BalenaOS, which polls an upstream API for updates.

This repo is that API they poll. It manages deployments / applications / devices and their state.
